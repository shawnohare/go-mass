# go-mass
Provides interfaces and methods to perform set/statistical operations on
data which have some notion of mass or value.  We chose the name due
to its length, connotation, and fact it is a real number.  The more
generic notion of function value does not correspond to a real number,
at least to the mathematician's mind.
